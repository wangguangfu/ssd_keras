    "### 1. Introduction and building the model\n",
    "\n",
    "The cell below sets a number of parameters that define the model architecture and then calls the function `ssd_300()` to build the model. The parameters as set below produce the original SSD300 architecture that was trained on the Pascal VOC datsets, i.e. they are all chosen to correspond exactly to their respective counterparts in the `.prototxt` file that defines the original Caffe implementation. Note that the anchor box scaling factors of the original SSD implementation vary depending on the datasets on which the authors trained their models. The scaling factors used for the MS COCO dataset are smaller than the scaling factors used for the Pascal VOC datasets, so keep that in mind if you want to reproduce the results from the paper. The scaling factors defined below are for the Pascal VOC datasets. The scaling factors are hard-coded as absolute pixel values in the `.prototxt`, but the relative scaling factors defined below produce exactly those absolute values at an image size of 300x300. The reason why the list of scaling factors has 7 elements while there are only 6 predictor layers is that the last scaling factor is used for the second aspect-ratio-1 box of the last predictor layer. See the documentation for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original SSD does not clip the anchor box coordinates to lie within the image boundaries, so `limit_boxes` is set to `False`. Doing this may seem counterintuitive, but it seems to lead to better model performance according to Wei Liu.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course I could just hard-code everything with the original model parameters and this notebook would be a lot cleaner, but the way it's set up here, if you want to train a model with SSD300 architecture from scratch on an arbitrary dataset, you can change the configuration with just a few clicks. For example, if you wanted to train a model that is more suitable to detect smaller objects, you can just change the scale parameters below accordingly (not to imply that this is guaranteed to help, but you get the point: I prefer things to be tweakable with little effort).\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameters set below are not only needed to build the model, but are also passed to the `SSDBoxEncoder` constructor in the subsequent cell, which is responsible for matching and encoding ground truth boxes and anchor boxes during training. In order to do that, it needs to know the anchor box specifications. It is for the same reason that `ssd_300()` does not only return the model itself, but also `predictor_sizes`, a list of the spatial sizes of the convolutional predictor layers - `SSDBoxEncoder` needs this information to know where the anchor boxes must be placed spatially.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original Caffe implementation does pretty much everything inside a model layer: The ground truth boxes are matched and encoded inside [MultiBoxLossLayer](https://github.com/weiliu89/caffe/blob/ssd/src/caffe/layers/multibox_loss_layer.cpp), and box decoding, confidence thresholding and non-maximum suppression is performed in [DetectionOutputLayer](https://github.com/weiliu89/caffe/blob/ssd/src/caffe/layers/detection_output_layer.cpp). In contrast to that, in the current form of this implementation, ground truth box matching and encoding happens as part of the mini batch generation (i.e. outside of the model itself). To be specific, `BatchGenerator` calls the `encode_y()` method of `SSDBoxEncoder` and then yields the matched and encoded target tensor to be passed to the loss function. Similarly, the model here outputs the raw prediction tensor. The decoding and confidence thresholding is then performed by `decode_y()` and non-maximum suppression is performed by `greedy_nms()`, i.e. also outside the model. It's (almost) the same process in both cases, it's just that the code is organized differently between this implementation and the original Caffe implementation, which likely has performance implications, but I haven't measured it yet. I might look into incorporating all processing steps inside the model itself, but for now it was just easier to take the non-learning-relevant steps outside of Keras/Tensorflow. This is one advantage of Caffe: It's more convenient to write complex custom layers in plain C++ than to grapple with the Keras/Tensorflow API."

    "\n",
    "There are two parameters in the SSDBoxEncoder that you should note: `pos_iou_threshold` and `neg_iou_threshold`. The former determines the minimum Jaccard overlap between a ground truth box and an anchor box for a match and is set to 0.5, the value stated in the paper. The latter, `neg_iou_threshold`, is not in the paper, but it is useful to improve the learning process. It determines the maximum allowed Jaccard overlap between an anchor box and any ground truth box in order for that anchor box to be considered a negative box. This is useful because you want a clear margin between negative and positive boxes. An anchor box that almost contains an object should not be forced to learn to predict a negative box in such a case. 0.2 is a reasonable value that is used by various other object detection models.\n",

The data augmentation features available in the generator are not identical to the techniques described in the paper, but they produce similar effects and work well nonetheless. If there is anything you don't understand, check out the documentation.\n",

You either need to load pre-trained weights for the modified VGG-16 base network as they did in the paper, or you need to modify the network to use dropout, batch normalization, decrease the depth, and/or play around with weight initialization to train from scratch."
